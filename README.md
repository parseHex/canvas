# `canvas`

A small library that handles common tasks with the HTML5 `<canvas>`.

This is for my own use, it's not a good idea to use this in anything but a personal project to make it easier to deal with the canvas.

## API

## Development

- `yarn start` to start watching source files
- `yarn build` to build the script to `./dist`
